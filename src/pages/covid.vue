          The world has been shocked by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic
          and no country is spared of the effects of the pandemic. However, the
          effects and strategies to cope with the effects of the pandemic might
          vary from one country to another. The purpose of this article,
          therefore, is to identify and discuss the effects of the Covid-19
          pandemic on the Nigeria’s economy and possible coping strategies. In
          addition to the viewpoint of the author, this paper undertook a review
          of the related literature regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and how
          Nigerians and the Nigerian government can cope with the effects of the
          pandemic. The review reveals that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic
          in Nigeria include jobs losses, a sharp drop in income of the informal
          workers and the poor, food insecurity, business and school closures, a
          steep decline in oil revenues and economic uncertainties. This paper
          has recommended some measures to be adopted by Nigerians and the
          Nigerian government in order to cope with the devastating effects of
          the Covid-19 pandemic and similar pandemics in future. The measures
          include monetary and fiscal policy measures, diversification of the
          economy through agriculture, revamping of the manufacturing sector,
          acquisition of relevant ICT skills, adoption of e-learning model by
          schools, adoption of e-business model by business organizations and
          the need to have multiple sources of income.
